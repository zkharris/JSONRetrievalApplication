The problem was to retrieve information over the network and display it in a RecyclerView. 
The solution was to create a standard RecyclerView and retrieve the information from the given url 
as a JSONArray and store those objects into the RecyclerView. My approach was to design the basic layout
first and and then handle retrieving the JSON and finally connecting those components and if those 
steps were done work on polishing the UI. Some trade offs I made were in code optimization. Because of
the time limit I tried to make everything work before making a particular component more efficient. For 
example in my RecyclerViewAdapter I used ViewHolders I was familiar with instead of looking for more optimal
ways of constructing the adapter. If I had additional time on the project I would work on polishing the 
front-end much more. I find this part of any application the most time consuming and requiring the most 
proficieny and attention to the Android SDK and it's changes over time.
